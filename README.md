# Flow
-Initially, when you land on a page, you can see the navbar, which allows you to navigate between multiple sections. On the right side, there are options available for signing in and signing up.

-After signing up or signing in, you can toggle between the homepage and the product list page. Upon signing in, the user's name, product list, and a logout button will appear in the navbar.

-When you click on "Products," you can view all available products. In the product view, you can add a new product, search by category, filter by name, and toggle between card and table views.

-In the table view, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the products.

-After clicking the logout button, the user will be logged out, and the page will be redirected to the homepage.

-I haven't been able to implement full responsive CSS for the entire page within one day.
